# This is a SSR (Server Side Rendered) React App built with NextJS & React, GSAP, Howler.js, Styled Components using Rebass and some other goodies!
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

# Installation
  - Pull down the Repo and run `yarn install` or `npm install`
  - Fire up the project by running `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
  - You'll need the Contentful CMS access tokens - email me ; )
  
# Deployment 
  - Deployment is handled using NOW [https://zeit.co/], they're the developers behind Next.js and seem like a pretty awesome company
  - I really like their CLI and use it and their hosting services for a variety of applications
  - Generally, install the NOW CLI and simply run NOW in the project root (if configured correctly). In our case, run `yarn now` in the project root to deploy to a auto generated url.
